# Task: Fix participant registration failure

## Completed
- Added backend validation to check if event_id exists before registration.
- Improved backend error handling to return detailed error messages.

## To Do
- Test participant registration flow end-to-end to confirm fix.
- Review and improve frontend error display if needed.
- Verify lib/api_service.dart registerParticipant method (already reviewed, looks correct).
- Optionally add more detailed error messages in frontend UI.

## Notes
- Backend now returns 400 error if event_id does not exist.
- Frontend currently shows generic error message on failure.

# Task: Improve registration data display and add sample data

## Completed
- Updated lib/registration_tab.dart to improve data display, add loading indicators, error handling, and fix search functionality.
- Created SQL insert queries in backend/sample_data.sql for events and registrations tables to populate with sample data.

## To Do
- Test the updated UI to ensure data is shown clearly.
- Run SQL queries to insert sample data and verify in the app.

## Notes
- Focus on making registration data visible and reliable in the UI.
- Provided sample data for testing the display functionality.
